## Solution

The simple solution to this problem is to create an array of size *n* and add the value *k* to each array element between the given indices, inclusive. While we're adding *k* to our array elements, we keep track of the largest value we've seen with a variable, *max*, and update it whenever we see a larger value.

Here is the simple solution in Java:

```java
long[] arr = new long[n];
long max = 0;

for (List<Integer> query : queries) {
	int start = query.get(0);
 	int end = query.get(1);
	long val = query.get(2);

	for (int i = start; i < end + 1; i++) {
		arr[i - 1] = arr[i - 1] + val;
		max = Math.max(max, arr[i - 1]);
	}
}
return max;
```

This solution works, but its runtime is *O(n Ã— m)* because in the worst case scenario we're updating *n* rows of our array *m* times.

The space complexity is *O(n)* because we're storing an an array of *n* elements.

How can we improve this?

### My Thought Process

I began to think of a more efficient solution to this problem. What is the bare minimum amount of data we need to store? Can we get away with storing less than *n* elements?

I thought of a solution where instead of using an array of size *n*, I would create a hashmap that maps each index we update to its value. That would save space in the case where *n* is large and *m* is small. It would take up more space than a simple array when *m* is as large or larger than *n* though. Similarly, the runtime would be better when than the simple array solution if the final array is sparse, and worse when the final array is dense.

For the worst case scenario when the final array is dense, I can't think of a more efficient solution than a simple array. 

How can we reduce the runtime?

I thought about how updating every element between *a* and *b* could be made more efficient. What if we stored *k* and the difference between *a* and *b* at index *a* in a list?

For example, if *n* is 3 and our first query is:

```
a = 1
b = 3
k = 5
```

We would create a list of *n* elements and store this query as:

```
[ [5, 2], [0, 0], [0, 0] ]
```

With *k* = 5 and *b - a = 2*. Then to calculate the max value we would iterate over every element in the list. The first element would tell us this index's value is 5 and we need to add 5 to the next two elements. 

Wait, that wouldn't work. What if the next query was:

```
a = 1
b = 2
k = 7
```

We can't store two different values of *k* with different ranges at the first index. What if we created a two dimensional dynamic list like this?

```
[ [5, 2], [0, 0], [0, 0] ]
    |
    V
  [7, 1]
```

That begins to make things complicated. I would have to make multiple stacks and pop elements in the right order to take into account overlapping query ranges. I don't think this would more efficient than the simple solution.

I looked to the Internet for a tip.

### Efficient Solution

I read a creative solution where they they solved the problem of overlapping indices. Let's go back to our example where *n* is 3 and our first query is:

```
a = 1
b = 3
k = 5
```

We create an array of size *n + 1*. Then we add *k* to index *a* and subtract *k* from index *b + 1*. Here is what our array would look like:

```
[5, 0, 0, -5]
```

To find our max value, we first keep track of a new value called *sum*. We iterate over our array and add the value at the current index to *sum*. At every index we check if *sum* is larger than our current max value. When we reach the end of our array, we will have the maximum value.

Let's find the max value of our example. I labeled what our values for *sum* and *max* are at every index:

```
       [5, 0, 0, -5]
sum ->  5  5  5  0
max ->  5  5  5  5
```

At the first index, we add 5 to our sum, then add 0, add 0, and add -5 at the last index. The max value *sum* reached was 5, and that's our answer.

What happens when our second query is:

```
a = 1
b = 2
k = 7
```

We add 7 to index *a* (1), subtract 7 from index *b + 1* (3), and go through the same process to calculate the max value. Here is our array:

```
[12, 0, -7, -5]
```

Here are *sum* and *max* at every index:

```
       [12,   0,  -7,  -5]
sum ->  12   12    5    0
max ->  12   12   12   12
```

When we reach the end of the array, *max* is 12 and that is our answer.

Here is the efficient solution in Java:

```java
long[] arr = new long[n + 1];

for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
	List<Integer> query = queries.get(i);
	int a = query.get(0);
	int b = query.get(1);
	int k = query.get(2);
	arr[a - 1] += k;
	arr[b] -= k;
}

long sum = 0;
long max = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	sum += arr[i];
	max = Math.max(max, sum);
}

return max;
```

What is the runtime and space complexity of our efficient solution?

The runtime of our algorithm is *O(n + m)* because we have to initially add *2m* values to our array and then iterate over *n* elements to calculate the max value.

The space complexity is the same as our simple solution, *O(n)*, because we're storing an array of size *n + 1*.
