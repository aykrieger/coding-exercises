## Solution

The simple solution to this problem is to create an array of size *n* and add the value *k* to each array element between the given indices, inclusive. While we're adding *k* to our array elements, we keep track of the largest value we've seen with a variable, *max*, and update it whenever we see a larger value.

Here is the simple solution in Java:

```java
long[] arr = new long[n];
long max = 0;

for (List<Integer> query : queries) {
	int start = query.get(0);
 	int end = query.get(1);
	long val = query.get(2);

	for (int i = start; i < end + 1; i++) {
		arr[i - 1] = arr[i - 1] + val;
		max = Math.max(max, arr[i - 1]);
	}
}
return max;
```

This solution works, but its runtime is *O(n Ã— m)* because in the worst case scenario we're updating *n* rows of our array *m* times.

The space complexity is *O(n)* because we're storing an an array of *n* elements.

How can we improve this?

### My Thought Process

I began to think of a more efficient solution to this problem. What is the bare minimum amount of data we need to store? Can we get away with storing less than *n* elements?

I thought of a solution where instead of using an array of size *n*, I would create a hashmap that maps each index we update to its value. That would save space in the case where *n* is large and *m* is small. It would take up more space than a simple array when *m* is as large or larger than *n* though. Similarly, the runtime would be better when than the simple array solution if the final array is sparse, and worse when the final array is dense.

For the worst case scenario when the final array is dense, I can't think of a more efficient solution than a simple array. 

How can we reduce the runtime?

I thought about how updating every element between *a* and *b* could be made more efficient. What if we stored *k* and the difference between *a* and *b* at index *a* in a list?

For example, *n* is 3 and our first query is:

```
a = 1
b = 3
k = 5
```

We would create a list of *n* elements and store this query as:

```
[ [5, 2], [0, 0], [0, 0] ]
```

Then to calculate the max value we would iterate over every element in the list. The first element would tell us this index's value is 5 and we need to add 5 to the next two elements. 

Wait, that wouldn't work. What if the next query was:

```
a = 1
b = 2
k = 7
```

We can't store two different of *k* with different ranges at the first index. What if we created a two dimensional dynamic list like this?

```
[ [5, 2], [0, 0], [0, 0] ]
    |
    V
  [7, 1]
```

That begins to make things complicated. I knew I was on the right track with storing the indices and *k* in an array, but calculating the max value from this data structure would not be easy. I would have to make multiple stacks and pop elements in the right order and take into account overlapping query ranges. I don't think this would more efficient than the simple solution.

I looked to the Internet for a tip.




No, that wouldn't work. If we encountered any two queries that had the same values for *a* or *b*, we wouldn't be able to store that in our array. If we used a different data structure to store multiple 











In order to reduce our runtime, we will have to get creative.

Instead of adding *k* to each array element between the left and right indices, we're going to add *k* to the left index and subtract *k* from the element immediately to the right of the right index.  

Let's say *n = 3* and our first query is:

```
a = 1
b = 3
k = 7
```

In our simple solution we would create an array with *n* (3) elements and add *k* (7) to each element between indices *a* (1) and *b* (3), inclusive:

```
Simple Solution

index -> 1  2  3
        [7, 7, 7]
```

In our new solution we start by creating an array with *n + 1* (4) elements. For each query, we add *k* (7) to index *a* (1) and subtract *k* (7) from index *b + 1* (4).

```
New Solution

index -> 1  2  3  4
        [7, 0, 0, -7]
```

Here is our new solution so far:

```java
long[] arr = new long[n + 1];

for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
	List<Integer> query = queries.get(i);
	int a = query.get(0);
	int b = query.get(1);
	int k = query.get(2);
	arr[a - 1] += k; 
 	arr[b] -= k;
}
```

In our problem statement, the given indices are 1-indexed, and in our code, the array is 0-indexed. So instead of adding *k* to *a*, we add *k* to *arr[a - 1]*. Instead of subtracting *k* from *b + 1*, we subtract *k* from *arr[b]*.

Back to our example. Here's our array after the first update in the new solution:

```
index -> 1   2   3   4
        [7,  0,  0, -7]
```

Let's say the next query is:

```
a = 3
b = 3
k = 5
```

After the update, our array will look like:

```
index -> 1  2  3  4
        [7, 0, 5, -12]
```

The next query is:

```
a = 2
b = 2
k = 10
```

And after the final update:

```
index -> 1   2   3   4
        [7,  10, -5, -12]
```

To find the max value in our new solution, we loop through our array from left to right and add each element to a *sum* variable. We also store the max value we've seen so far in a *max* variable.

```
index -> 1   2   3   4
        [7,  10, -5, -12]
sum   -> 7   17  12  0
max   -> 7   17  17  17
```

The value of *max* is 17 when we reach the end of the array and that's our answer. Here is the code for the full solution:

```java
long[] arr = new long[n + 1];

for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
	List<Integer> query = queries.get(i);
	int a = query.get(0);
	int b = query.get(1);
	int k = query.get(2);
	arr[a - 1] += k; 
 	arr[b] -= k;
}

long sum = 0;
long max = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	sum += arr[i];
	max = Math.max(max, sum);
}
 
return max;
```
